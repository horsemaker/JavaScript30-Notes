# 10 - Hold Shift and check Checkboxes

## .shiftKey
- The **`KeyboardEvent.shiftKey`** read-only property is a boolean value that indicates if the shift key was pressed (true) or not (false) when the event occurred.

- Syntax:
    ```
    var shiftKeyPressed = instanceOfKeyboardEvent.shiftKey
    ```


## .checked
- A **`Boolean attribute`** indicating whether or not this checkbox is checked by default (when the page loads). It does not indicate whether this checkbox is currently checked: if the checkbox’s state is changed, this content attribute does not reflect the change. (Only the HTMLInputElement’s checked IDL attribute is updated.)
