## mouseup
- The **`mouseup`** event is fired at an Element when a button on a pointing device (such as a mouse or trackpad) is released while the pointer is located inside it.

## mousedown
- The **`mousedown`** event is fired at an Element when a pointing device button is pressed while the pointer is inside the element.

## mousemove
- The **`mousemove`** event is fired at an element when a pointing device (usually a mouse) is moved while the cursor's hotspot is inside it.

## cursor: -webkit-grabbing
- Applications based on **`WebKit`** or Blink, such as Safari and Chrome, support a number of special WebKit extensions to CSS. These extensions are generally prefixed with **-webkit-**. Most -webkit- prefixed properties also work with an -apple- prefix. A few are prefixed with -epub-.
- The **`cursor`** CSS property sets the mouse cursor, if any, to show when the mouse pointer is over an element.
- **`grabbing`** : Something is being grabbed (dragged to be moved).
## .pageX
- The **`pageX`** read-only property of the MouseEvent interface returns the X (horizontal) coordinate (in pixels) at which the mouse was clicked, relative to the left edge of the entire document. This includes any portion of the document not currently visible.
## scrollLeft
- The **`Element.scrollLeft`** property gets or sets the number of pixels that an element's content is scrolled from its left edge.
